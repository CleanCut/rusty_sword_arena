//! # Rusty Sword Arena - Game Design
//!
//! Rusty Sword Arena is a networked, 2D, top-down, arena combat game.  A server implementation and
//! shared library is provided.  Your task is to implement a game client in Rust using the provided
//! shared library and the game design details below.
//!
//! Note that while significant effort has been put into making the server _robust_ and unlikely to
//! crash, there has consciously been very little effort towards security, or pretty much any proper
//! game engine architecture.  In other words, this is a great way to learn Rust and have some fun
//! at the same time, but this in no way pretends to be a substitute for a _real game engineâ„¢_ like
//! [amethyst](https://amethyst.rs/) or [ggez](https://ggez.rs/). ðŸ˜‰
//!
//! ## Basic Gameplay
//!
//! The basic idea of the game is you are presented with the top-down view of a person (circle) in
//! an arena (your window) who can swing his weapon (a rusty sword) in a circle.  You can face any
//! direction you like, turning is instant as far as the server is concerned.  You can move in any
//! direction (which is _not_ instant, the server implements some rudimentary movement physics) and
//! attempt to attack other players with your sword.  If another player is within the radius of
//! your sword reach when you attack, they will be hurt and their health will go down.  You will be
//! limited to 50% movement speed while attacking, so try to time your attack to when they will be
//! successful.
//!
//! You start with some health. When you are hit, you lose health.  When the health runs out, you
//! die and the person who killed you gets a point.  After a respawn delay, you respawn with full
//! health.  If you attempt to run from the arena, you are likely to be eaten by a grue.  Being
//! eaten by a grue causes you to lose a point, but there is no point penalty when another player
//! kills you.
//!
//! ## Preparation
//!
//! First, you should follow the
//! [instructions on the readme](https://github.com/cleancut/rusty_sword_arena#preparation---do-this-before-oscon)
//! to install some dependencies.  Then come back here and keep going.
//!
//! ## Creating Your Game Client
//!
//! These are all things we will do together in the tutorial.  Feel free to get ahead of the group
//! if you can!
//!
//! - Pick a name for your client and create a Rust crate.  Hint: use `cargo`
//! - Obtain the player's desired `name` and the `host` to connect to.
//!   - One easy way is to get the name and host from the command-line.
//!   - See [args](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/env/fn.args.html) for the code part.
//! - Add `rusty_sword_arena` as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml` file.
//! - Create a [ServerConnection](net/struct.ServerConnection.html) using the `host`
//! - Use the [ServerConnection](net/struct.ServerConnection.html) to join the game
//!   - You should hold onto that ID so you know which player you are.
//!   - You should probably handle the possible didn't-join condition.
//! - Use the [ServerConnection](net/struct.ServerConnection.html) to get a
//!   [GameSetting](game/struct.GameSetting.html).  If `version` in game setting does not match
//!   [VERSION](constant.VERSION.html) in the rusty_sword_arena module you are using, you may want
//!   to abort the game...and then fix your `Cargo.toml`.
//! - Add [impose](https://crates.io/crates/impose) as a dependency.
//! - Use impose to add your audio to an
//!   [audio system](https://docs.rs/impose/0.2.0/impose/struct.Audio.html).  You can use
//!   these free placeholder sounds either
//!   [individually](https://github.com/CleanCut/rusty_sword_arena/tree/master/media)
//!   or [zipped up](https://agileperception.com/static/media.zip)
//!   if you like, or [record](https://www.audacityteam.org/) or [create](https://www.bfxr.net/)
//!   your own sounds!  (Or you can skip sounds altogether, really).
//! - Create a [Window](gfx/struct.Window.html)
//! - IN YOUR MAIN GAME LOOP...
//!     - Gather any keyboard/mouse input from the [Window](gfx/struct.Window.html)
//!       you created, and then [coalesce](game/struct.PlayerInput.html#method.coalesce)
//!       it into a persistent [PlayerInput](game/struct.PlayerInput.html).
//!         - Every ~15ms, send the coalesced input to the server and reset your input
//!         - If the player wants to quit, here's the place to break out of the game loop
//!     - Get all the pending [GameState](game/struct.GameState.html)s from the server.
//!         - FOR EACH GAME STATE (which represents the state of one frame)
//!         - Process all the [PlayerState](game/struct.PlayerState.html)s into some local
//!           collection(s) that represent the client's view of players and their graphics.
//!         - Play sounds as desired, based on player events
//!     - Loop through your local state storage and draw a frame that represents the latest state
//!       of the players.
//! ...
//!
//! ## Challenges!
//!
//! Here are some things we will NOT do together in the tutorial.  If you are ahead of the class, or
//! want to keep going after the class, here's some challenges you could take on!
//!
//! - Every GameState includes a [HighScores](game/struct.HighScores.html) struct. Why not do
//!   something with it?  You could just print it to the console every once-in-awhile, or do
//!   something more interesting.
//! - Your player might sometimes appear underneath other players if they overlap. Make your player
//!   always render on top.
//! - Which player is yours among so many circles!?!? Add some visual indicator as to which
//!   player is yours.
//! - **Multiple players from one client** - The server and networking protocol do not prevent a
//!   single client from adding multiple players to the game. Create some way to divide the
//!   keyboard/mouse input up among two or more local players who will play through the same client.
//! - **AI** - Who says a human has to do the playing?  The server is giving you all the information
//!   about all the players's states.  Use that information to develop an AI player who plays by
//!   himself.
//! - **RTS** - Who says you have to control everything little movement?  Combine one or both of the
//!   above challenges to implement a real-time strategy interface, where you direct one (or more)
//!   players   controlled by your client to achieve a goal (move somewhere, attack things, run
//!   away, etc) and then your controlled players autonomously attempt to achieve that goal until
//!   you specify otherwise.
//! - **Better Graphics** - Improve on the graphics.  Either make better use of the provided
//!   shapes to indicate more of what is going on, or dig into the RSA `gfx.rs` module and augment
//!   it with new and better graphical capabilities.  Health indicators sure would be nice.
//! - **Better Sound** - The sound library we used is pretty limited.  Add new sounds, or improve
//!   the underlying sound system.  The sound library that `impose` uses is called
//!   [rodio](https://github.com/tomaka/rodio) -- you could use it directly.  Or you could switch
//!   to a similar, but better high-level library like [ears](https://github.com/jhasse/ears).
//! - **Improve Rusty Sword Arena Itself** -- Fork
//!   [Rusty Sword Arena](https://github.com/CleanCut/rusty_sword_arena).  Add features, or fix
//!   bugs in the server.
//!   - Improve the reference client implementation.
//!   - Port the graphics subsystem from OpenGL to Vulkan.
//!   - Add more graphics primitives (rectangles for healthbars, for example).
//!   - Add the ability to render text.
//!   - Port the network subsystem from ZeroMQ to [nanomsg](https://nanomsg.org/).
//!   - Improve the network methods' abilities to indicate what exactly happened (was the name
//!     taken? was the game full?)
//!   - Port the sound subsystem from `impose` to something better.
//!   - Update the documentation to be clearer, more comprehensive, and have more useful links.
//!   - Add support for Game Modes (Teams? Capture the flag?).
//!   - Add multiple weapon types and random weapon drops to pick up.
//!   - Add the ability to Parry (you can try to attack OR parry - a successful parry causes the
//!     attacking player to have a much larger delay than usual before the next attack attempt).
//!   - Add player collision.
//!   - [Create an issue](https://github.com/CleanCut/rusty_sword_arena/issues/new) if you
//!     have ideas you want to discuss, or need help.
//!   - [Create a Pull Request](https://github.com/CleanCut/rusty_sword_arena/compare) if you would
//!     like feedback on your code, or if think your change is ready to contribute back to the main
//!     project.
