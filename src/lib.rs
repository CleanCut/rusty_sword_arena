//! # Rusty Sword Arena - Game Design
//!
//! Rusty Sword Arena is a networked, 2D, top-down, arena combat game.  A server implementation and
//! shared library is provided.  Your task is to implement a game client in Rust using the provided
//! shared library and the game design details below.
//!
//! Note that while significant effort has been put into making the server _robust_ and unlikely to
//! crash, there has consciously been very little effort towards security, or pretty much any proper
//! game engine architecture.  In other words, this is a great way to learn Rust and have some fun
//! at the same time, but this in no way pretends to be a substitute for a _real game engineâ„¢._ ðŸ˜‰
//!
//! ## Prerequisites
//!
//! First you should follow the [instructions on the readme](https://github.com/cleancut/rusty_sword_arena)
//! to install some prerequisites.  Then come back here and keep going.
//!
//! ## Game Client Responsibilities
//!
//! - Obtain the player's desired `name` and the `host` to connect to.
//! - Create a [ServerConnection](struct.ServerConnection.html) using the `host`
//! - Using the server connection, send a [GameControlMsg](game/enum.GameControlMsg.html) to join
//!   the game and save the [GameSetting](game/struct.GameSetting.html) you get back.
//! - Determine your player's id and save it
//! - ...
